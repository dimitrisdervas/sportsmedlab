## **Program Overview**

This 12-week at-home Zoom-based program is specifically designed for adolescents with BMIs over 35 who have no previous exercise experience. The program incorporates evidence-based exercise science principles while ensuring safety, gradual progression, and long-term adherence through a periodized approach.

## **Required Equipment**

| Equipment | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| Chair (sturdy, without wheels) | Support for movements and balance during exercises |
| Water bottles or light weights (1-3 lbs) | Initial resistance training implements |
| Resistance bands (light and medium) | Progressive strength development |
| Small step or thick book | For step-up exercises and elevation training |
| Exercise mat or towel | Comfort and joint protection during floor exercises |
| Broomstick or PVC pipe | Movement pattern training and technique development |
| Backpack (can be filled with books) | Adjustable progressive loading mechanism |
| Laptop/tablet | Zoom session participation and instruction delivery |

**Equipment Selection Rationale:** The equipment listed has been carefully selected to be accessible, affordable, and commonly available in most homes. By utilizing everyday objects instead of specialized gym equipment, we remove barriers to participation while still enabling effective exercise progression. The chair provides stability for deconditioned participants, while water bottles and resistance bands allow for gradual load progression without intimidating weight equipment. This approach acknowledges the psychological barriers many adolescents with obesity face regarding traditional fitness environments.

## **Program Design Variables**

| Variable | Details | Scientific Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Duration | Progresses from 20 to 45 minutes over 12 weeks | Gradual adaptation to exercise stress |
| Volume | Increases through additional sets and reps | Progressive overload principle |
| Intensity | Measured using Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale (1-10) | Self-regulation of effort appropriate for beginners |
| Rest periods | Decrease as fitness improves (90s → 60s) | Development of work capacity and recovery ability |
| Periodization | Undulating: alternates between volume and intensity focus | Optimizes adaptation while preventing overtraining |

## **Zoom Session Setup Guidelines**

1. Position camera so the instructor can see full body movements  
2. Clear a space at least 6'x6' for safe movement  
3. Have water available throughout the session  
4. Wear comfortable athletic clothing and supportive shoes  
5. Ensure there's something nearby to hold onto for balance if needed

## **Program Progression Model**

| Phase | Weeks | Session Duration | RPE Target | Rest Between Sets | Primary Focus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Foundation | 1-4 | 20-25 minutes | 3-5 | 90 seconds | Movement patterns and technique |
| Development | 5-8 | 25-35 minutes | 5-6 | 75 seconds | Building work capacity |
| Advancement | 9-12 | 35-45 minutes | 6-7 | 60 seconds | Strength and challenge progression |

**Progression Model Rationale:** The phased approach is designed to respect the physiological and psychological realities of exercising with a higher BMI. Beginning with shorter sessions focused on movement competency acknowledges the higher metabolic cost of movement for individuals with obesity. The gradual increase in intensity and duration allows for musculoskeletal adaptation, reducing injury risk. Rest periods are initially longer to accommodate the typically reduced recovery capacity in this population, then gradually decrease to improve work capacity. This structured progression optimizes adherence by ensuring early success while systematically preparing the body for greater challenges.

## **Weekly Training Schedule Options**

### 2-Day Option

| Day | Focus | RPE Range | Volume Characteristics | Emphasis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Monday | Higher Volume | 3-5 | More reps, lower resistance | Movement patterns, endurance |
| Friday | Higher Intensity | 4-6 | Fewer reps, more resistance | Strength development |

### 3-Day Option

| Day | Focus | RPE Range | Volume Characteristics | Emphasis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Monday | Higher Intensity | 4-6 | Lower reps, higher resistance | Technique, strength |
| Wednesday | Recovery/Skill | 2-4 | Moderate volume, lower intensity | Mobility, skill development |
| Friday | Higher Volume | 3-5 | Higher reps, moderate resistance | Endurance, work capacity |

**Schedule Design Rationale:** The dual scheduling options acknowledge the varying availability and initial exercise capacity of participants. The 2-day model provides adequate recovery for severely deconditioned individuals while still delivering sufficient stimulus for adaptation. The 3-day option introduces a dedicated recovery/skill day that focuses on movement quality without excessive physical demand. The undulating approach (alternating between intensity and volume) optimizes neuromuscular adaptation while preventing overtraining and psychological burnout. This approach also accommodates the typically prolonged recovery time observed in individuals with higher BMIs.

## **FOUNDATION PHASE (WEEKS 1-4)**

### Phase Goals and Objectives

The Foundation Phase focuses on establishing proper movement patterns, building exercise confidence, and developing baseline levels of muscular endurance. This phase is critical for long-term success as it:

- Develops neuromuscular coordination for fundamental movement patterns  
- Establishes proper exercise technique under low-load conditions  
- Builds exercise self-efficacy through achievable progressions  
- Introduces the concept of regular exercise as a sustainable habit  
- Minimizes risk of injury through controlled loading parameters

During this phase, emphasize quality of movement over quantity. The relatively low intensity (RPE 3-5) allows participants to focus on proper form without excessive fatigue interfering with motor learning. The extended rest periods (90 seconds) ensure adequate recovery between sets, which is particularly important for deconditioned individuals.

### Weekly Schedule Structure

#### 2-Day Option

| Day | Focus | RPE | Volume Characteristics | Primary Emphasis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Monday | Higher Volume | 3-4 | 1-2 sets of 10-12 reps | Movement patterns and technique |
| Friday | Higher Intensity | 4-5 | 1-2 sets of 6-8 reps | Quality of movement and controlled effort |

#### 3-Day Option

| Day | Focus | RPE | Primary Emphasis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Monday | Higher Intensity | 4 | Lower reps, focus on technique |

### Addressing Adherence Challenges in Foundation Phase

During the Foundation Phase, participants may experience several common challenges that can affect adherence:

1. **Perceived lack of intensity**: Some participants may feel the exercises are too easy and become disengaged. Explain that mastering technique first is essential for long-term progress and injury prevention. Consider adding a challenge focus (such as balance or coordination) while maintaining appropriate loading.  
     
2. **Difficulty with specific movements**: If a participant struggles with a particular movement pattern, provide regression options immediately. For example, if chair squats are challenging, reduce depth or increase support. Create a "success ladder" with smaller incremental steps for that specific movement.  
     
3. **Inconsistent attendance**: For participants missing sessions, provide a simplified "catch-up" routine they can perform independently. Keep this to 10-15 minutes with 3-4 key exercises that maintain continuity with the program progression.  
     
4. **Motivation fluctuations**: Connect exercises to functional improvements in daily life. For example, explain how squats relate to sitting/standing and climbing stairs. Create a "victories journal" where participants note improvements in everyday activities.  
     
5. **Technical difficulties with Zoom**: Have backup options ready, such as pre-recorded demonstration videos participants can access asynchronously, or written descriptions with pictures of key exercises.

The success of this phase should be measured not just by physical improvements but by the development of exercise self-efficacy and the establishment of consistent participation patterns.

## **DEVELOPMENT PHASE (WEEKS 5-8)**

### Phase Goals and Objectives

The Development Phase builds upon the movement foundation established in the first four weeks, gradually increasing challenge while maintaining technical proficiency. This phase aims to:

- Increase muscular strength through progressive loading  
- Improve work capacity and exercise tolerance  
- Develop greater movement confidence and body awareness  
- Introduce more challenging exercise variations  
- Build self-regulation skills through intensity management

This phase represents a critical transition where participants begin to experience noticeable improvements in function and capacity. The moderate intensity (RPE 5-6) challenges participants while still allowing for technique refinement. The slightly reduced rest periods (75 seconds) begin to develop greater work capacity and metabolic endurance.

### Weekly Schedule Structure

| Implementation | Can be interspersed between strength exercises as "active recovery" | Strategic placement in workout |
| RPE Target | 5-6 | Challenging but sustainable |

### Addressing Adherence Challenges in Development Phase

The Development Phase often presents unique challenges as exercise intensity increases:

1. **Fatigue management**: As workload increases, some participants may experience greater fatigue. Implement a "flexible intensity day" approach where participants can reduce volume by 25% on days when energy is low while maintaining the program structure.  
     
2. **Plateaus in progress**: Some participants may perceive a slowdown in improvement. Introduce alternative progress markers beyond repetitions and weight, such as movement quality ratings, recovery rate between sets, or subjective effort for the same workload.  
     
3. **Comparison concerns**: As participants become more aware of their capabilities, social comparison may increase. Emphasize individualized progress tracking and implement a "personal victory" highlight at the end of each session where participants share improvements specific to their journey.  
     
4. **Technical regressions**: Under increased load, movement quality may deteriorate. Implement periodic "technique reset" sessions with lighter loads focusing solely on movement quality. Create a "technique checklist" for each core movement that participants can self-assess.  
     
5. **Scheduling conflicts**: As the novelty wears off, consistency may waver. Develop a "minimum effective dose" workout (15-20 minutes) for weeks with high external demands that maintains program continuity without overwhelming participants.

Success in this phase is indicated by improved movement quality under load, increased work capacity, and growing confidence in exercise self-regulation rather than just increased load or repetitions.

## **ADVANCEMENT PHASE (WEEKS 9-12)**

### Phase Goals and Objectives

The Advancement Phase represents the culmination of the program, challenging participants at the upper end of their current capabilities while reinforcing long-term exercise sustainability. This phase aims to:

- Further develop strength through more challenging movement variations  
- Introduce more complex coordination and unilateral exercises  
- Enhance metabolic conditioning through structured circuit training  
- Develop greater exercise autonomy and self-regulation  
- Prepare participants for continued exercise progression beyond the program

This phase introduces more advanced exercise variations that require greater neuromuscular control and core stability. The higher intensity (RPE 6-7) challenges participants while the shortened rest periods (60 seconds) further develop work capacity and recovery ability. Success in this phase demonstrates significant progress from baseline and prepares participants for continued independent exercise.

### Addressing Adherence Challenges in Advancement Phase

The Advancement Phase presents unique challenges as participants approach the conclusion of the structured program:

1. **Exercise intensity concerns**: Some participants may feel intimidated by the increased demands. Implement a "challenge scale" where every exercise has three clearly defined levels (A, B, C) that participants can self-select based on daily capacity while staying within the overall framework.  
     
2. **Irregular attendance**: As the program concludes, attendance might become erratic. Create "bridge workouts" specific to each participant's progress level that can be completed independently to maintain continuity between attended sessions.  
     
3. **Transition anxiety**: Concerns about continuing exercise after program completion may arise. Begin introducing "independence training" where participants lead portions of the warm-up or select exercises within parameters, building confidence in self-directed exercise.  
     
4. **Progress variability**: Participants will reach different achievement levels. Implement an "individualized milestone" approach where each participant identifies and celebrates achievements specific to their journey, rather than comparing to program standards or other participants.  
     
5. **Motivation for completion**: Some may lose motivation as the end approaches. Create a "final phase challenge" with specific, achievable goals for each participant to accomplish by program end, with recognition planned for the final session.

Success in this phase should be measured by the development of exercise independence, confidence in self-regulation, and the creation of sustainable plans for continued physical activity beyond the program's conclusion.

## **RECOVERY MONITORING AND PROGRESSION GUIDELINES**

### Morning Heart Rate Monitoring Protocol

| Measurement | Procedure | Interpretation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Method | Take 15-second pulse upon waking (still lying in bed) | Multiply by 4 for beats per minute |
| Frequency | Daily recording in exercise journal | Track trends over time |
| Alert threshold | \>5 beats per minute from baseline | Potential sign of incomplete recovery |
| Action if elevated | Reduce session intensity (lower RPE target by 1-2 points) | Prioritize quality movement over intensity |

### Session Recovery Assessment

| Measurement | Procedure | Interpretation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1-Minute Heart Rate Recovery | 1\. Check pulse immediately after exercise (15-sec count × 4\) 2\. Rest completely for 60 seconds 3\. Check pulse again (15-sec count × 4\) 4\. Calculate difference | Recovery of \<20 bpm suggests need for more recovery |
| RPE Monitoring | Record RPE after each major exercise and overall session | Track changes in perceived effort for same workload |
| Next-Day Soreness | Rate muscle soreness 24 hours post-exercise on 0-10 scale | Should remain between 2-4/10 for optimal progression |

### Resistance Progression Guidelines

| Phase | When to Progress | How to Progress | Regression Indicators |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Foundation | RPE \<4 for two consecutive sessions | First increase repetitions, then add minimal resistance | Form deterioration, excessive soreness, elevated morning HR |
| Development | RPE \<5 for two consecutive sessions | Increase resistance by 5-10% | Recovery between sessions \>48 hours, form changes |
| Advancement | RPE \<6 for two consecutive sessions | Increase resistance by 5-10% or add unilateral variations | Recovery incomplete within 48 hours, technique breakdown |

## **ECCENTRIC TRAINING IMPLEMENTATION**

Eccentric training (emphasizing the lowering phase of movements) is strategically implemented throughout the program to maximize strength development while minimizing joint stress, particularly beneficial for this population.

| Phase | Eccentric Focus | Implementation Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Foundation | One exercise per session receives eccentric emphasis | 2-3 second lowering phases on key movements |
| Development | Two exercises per session receive eccentric focus | 3-4 second lowering phases with proper alignment |
| Advancement | One dedicated eccentric-focused session per week | 5-second lowering phases, 1.5 reps, mid-range pauses |

### Volume Adjustment for Eccentric Training

When implementing dedicated eccentric training, reduce total volume by 25% to account for increased neuromuscular demand and recovery requirements.

## **PROGRESS TRACKING FRAMEWORK**

### Functional Assessment Battery (Performed Every 4 Weeks)

| Assessment | Procedure | Measurement | Relevance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 30-second Chair Stand Test | Count complete stands in 30 seconds | Number of repetitions | Lower body strength and endurance |
| Modified Wall Push-Up Test | Count completed push-ups in 30 seconds | Number of repetitions | Upper body strength and endurance |
| Seated Reach Test | Measure forward flexibility from seated position | Distance reached (cm) | Hamstring and lower back flexibility |
| Single-Leg Balance | Time how long they can balance | Seconds (max 30\) | Static balance and proprioception |
| 2-Minute Step Test | Count steps in place with knees to mid-thigh height | Number of steps | Cardiovascular endurance |

### Psychological Assessment Measures

| Measure | Assessment Method | Frequency | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Exercise Self-Efficacy | 5-question Likert scale survey | Bi-weekly | Confidence in exercise abilities |
| Program Enjoyment | 1-10 scale rating | Weekly | Program satisfaction and adherence predictor |
| Perceived Competence | 3-question assessment | Monthly | Subjective skill development |
| Motivation Type | Adapted motivation questionnaire | Monthly | Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation tracking |

## **IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS**

### Integration with Emotional Support Framework

This physical program should be implemented in conjunction with the emotional support framework detailed in the accompanying document. The physical and psychological aspects of the program must be viewed as interdependent components of a holistic approach.

### Family Involvement Strategy

While respecting adolescent autonomy, strategic family involvement can enhance program effectiveness. Implementation should include:

- Clear guidelines for parents on appropriate support versus interference  
- Optional family participation in select exercises  
- Communication tools for adolescents to express support preferences to family members  
- Education for family on avoiding weight-focused or critical comments

### Long-Term Sustainability Planning

The 12-week program should include graduated transition to independent exercise. Beginning in Week 9, participants should:

- Identify personally enjoyable movement patterns to continue independently  
- Develop a simplified "maintenance program" for use between potential future program cycles  
- Create a personal resource list of movement options based on preferences and available resources  
- Establish appropriate self-monitoring systems that do not create unhealthy fixations

### Cultural Sensitivity in Implementation

Program administrators must recognize and accommodate:

- Cultural differences in body image perception and ideals  
- Varied family attitudes toward physical activity  
- Potential language barriers in instruction delivery  
- Cultural considerations regarding movement types or exercise attire  
- Diverse perspectives on health priorities and outcomes

## **CONCLUSION**

This comprehensive 12-week program provides a structured, evidence-based approach to introducing exercise to adolescents with BMIs over 35\. The carefully progressed phases prioritize safety, self-efficacy development, and long-term adherence while building fundamental movement patterns and physical capabilities. Success should be measured not only by physical improvements but by the development of positive relationships with movement, enhanced self-efficacy, and the establishment of sustainable exercise patterns beyond program completion.
