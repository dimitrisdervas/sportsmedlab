## Short CV

Asterios Deligiannis is a Cardiologist (1982) and Professor of Sports Medicine in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (1992-today). Prof A. Deligiannis has long-term experience with cardiological investigations and modern non invasive cardiac methods in the area of Sports Cardiology, which are performed at the Laboratory of Sports Medicine. He established (1993) the biggest Sports Cardiology center in Greece for the medical screening of athletes and applied effective pre-participation screeningprotocols for athletes, including the use of telemedicine methods. Duringthis period (1993-today) more than 30,000 athletes were examined for their cardiovascular preparticipation screening. His research has focused on the cardiovascular responses and adaptations of exercise training in athletes and patients with chronic diseases. He has also established in Greece exercise rehabilitation programs for renal patients during their hemodialysis sessions, as well as for cardiac patients in public gyms. He has special research experience on the effects of exercise training on cardiac morphology and function and on skeletal muscle atrophy in experimental projects. He is the primary investigator of many projects in exercise rehabilitation in patients with cardiac and other chronic diseases. He has also participated in four EU-projects about the biomedical side effects of doping and information campaign and fight against doping in sports. He is the co-author of the website created about health side effects of doping (http://www.doping-prevention.com/). He was Chairman-elect of the Department of Physical Education and Sports Science, member of the Senate, the Research Committee and the Ethic Committee of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki for six years. He was the Chairman of annual teleconference educational seminars in sports Medicine between Greece and Cyprus for the last 4 years. He was Chairman of the Organizing Committee of 14 International Congresses on Sports Medicine and 5 International Symposiums on Exercise and Quality of life in Chronic Diseases. He has more than 250 publications in scientific journals. He has present more than 300 lecturers in International Congresses and he was chairman (or co-chairman) in more than 60 scientific round tables. He was a member of the advisory board of 5 international and 4 Greek scientific journals. Prof. A. Deligiannis has successfully supervised to completion 42 research masters or PhD students, 32 of them as Principal Supervisor.
